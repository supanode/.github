# About Supanode

**We're the nerds who make blockchain infrastructure actually work.**

## Who We Are

Engineers, degens, on-chain enthusiasts. We built the infrastructure we wanted to use — fast, reliable, and free of everything annoying.

- Infrastructure nerds
- On-chain builders
- Performance obsessed
- Zero bullshit policy

## Our Story

### The Problem

We know firsthand what it's like when your transaction gets stuck for hours or your RPC goes down at the worst possible moment. We've been there. We've felt that pain. And we got tired of it.

### The Solution

So we built what we actually wanted to use. Enterprise-grade nodes and API services for leading blockchain networks. Dedicated and shared endpoints, real-time data streaming, priority transaction submission, historical indexers — a complete toolkit for serious projects.

## Why Supanode?

Because we're from this industry. We know the difference between "advertised" and real performance.

Our infrastructure is deployed in premium datacenters worldwide, right next to the largest validator clusters. This isn't marketing talk — ultra-low latency is a measurable fact, not an advertising slogan.

You pay for the performance you get. We don't sell air and we don't promise the impossible. But when we promise something — we deliver.

### The Edge

- Premium datacenters
- Near validator clusters
- Measurable latency
- No marketing fluff

## Our Values

### NO BULLSHIT
We don't oversell. We don't hide fees. What you see is what you get.

### BUILDER MINDSET
We use our own infrastructure. If it's not good enough for us, it's not good enough for you.

### SPEED OBSESSION
Every millisecond matters. We optimize relentlessly because your edge depends on it.

### REAL SUPPORT
24/7 help from humans who actually understand what you're building.

## Who We Serve

### Developers
From testing your first idea to production-ready clusters with guaranteed availability.

### Traders
Trading strategies, bots, HFT systems — infrastructure that keeps up with your speed.

### Enterprises
Marketplaces, analytics dashboards, DeFi protocols — we've seen it all and we're ready to help.

## The Human Side

At the end of the day, we just love what we do. Blockchain infrastructure is our thing. We're not here because it's "trendy" — we're here because we genuinely believe in a decentralized future and want to make it a little faster and more reliable.
